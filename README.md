This Python script retrieves file reports using the [VirusTotal API v3](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload). With just the file's hash value and a VirusTotal API Key, anyone can easily execute it.

[**Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ**](README-ja.md)
## üöÄ Features
- **Easy File Report Retrieval**: Utilizes VirusTotal's [Get a file report](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/file-info) API to easily fetch file reports.
- **Automation**: Sequentially and automatically retrieves data based on a list of hash values.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling, including processing for reaching [API limits](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/public-vs-premium-api).
  - **Request Rate**: Accounts for the limit of 4 requests per minute and 500 requests per day.
  - **Waiting Function**: Automatically waits until the next day (Default, UTC 01:00) if the limit is exceeded.
- **Log Output**: Outputs execution logs in the `logs` directory. Log names are recorded in Japan Standard Time. 
- **Data Saving**: Saves the retrieved data in JSON format in the `vt_reports` directory.
